    <p class="mt-3">
      Madhya Pradesh has recorded 43% of its total COVID-19 cases just in the
      month of April itself. The health system of the state has collapsed. Thus,
      a small group of us has come together from all across Madhya Pradesh in an
      effort to reach out to the patients and their families battling with this
      second wave of the deadly virus in maximum possible ways. Since the start
      of this initiative, our phones have been continuously ringing with
      requests for urgent assistance in the procurement of oxygen cylinders,
      medications, and even access to hospital beds. Despite our best efforts to
      extend support, there is a persisting sense of helplessness and
      powerlessness that we experience when our will to help people conflicts
      with the practical limitations of our resources. Hence, in order to
      increase the scope of our assistance to many more people in need, it is
      essential for us to be able to expand our resource pool. With your
      support, we aspire to procure oxygen concentrators for emergency cases;
      PPE Kits for untested COVID-19 patients especially in village areas; and
      N-95 masks, sanitizers, and hand gloves for frontline workers like
      ambulance drivers, food distributors, etc. We are also trying to arrange
      the refilling of already procured oxygen cylinders and oximeters for
      patients in government hospitals who are left unattended, patients from
      poor economic backgrounds, and ASHA workers for frequent check-ups of
      patients in their areas. We also plan to prepare and distribute 500 food
      packets per day for patient attendants in government hospitals.
